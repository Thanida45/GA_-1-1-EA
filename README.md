### MSc Project: Software Engineering Project Planning Using Genetic Algorithms

There are two programs which are the Genetic Algorithm and (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm. 

The name of the Genetic Algorithm is called TryGA.

The name of the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm is called TryEA. 

Both programs are implemented on NetBeans 8.1 by using JAVA language. 

Both programs run by using the main class of the application. 

The outputs of the applications may run automatically until the end of the iteration. 

Both programs are flexible for changing the data in the sample project plan.

The application for the Wilcoxon rank sum test

The application (“R”) is used for the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 

The R calculates the p-value of the different data between two algorithms; the GA and the (1+1) EA.
