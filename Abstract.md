# Abstract

In the project planning, there is a critical problem which is the task allocation problem. In the past research, when this problem occurs in a project plan, it may affect the completion time of the project, the use of resources and the investment costs, the reliability and public image of the company. Genetic Algorithm which is a Search-Based technique in Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is used to solve this problem. The aim of this project is to address the task allocation problem by using Genetic Algorithms. This aim focuses on the minimisation of the completion times of the project plans and takes into account the robustness of the project plans. This project presents a sample project plan model of task allocation, designs the fitness functions for finding the solution and explains the works of the programming. The project shows the results of two different programmes between the Genetic Algorithm and a basic technique ((1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm). The project also presents the effectiveness of the Genetic Algorithm when the program considering the minimisation of the completion times of the project plans and focuses on the robustness.
